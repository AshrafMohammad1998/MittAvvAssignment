# Kanban Board Application

This project is a Kanban board developed using ReactJS, allowing users to manage tasks across different stages: **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Peer Review**, and **Done**. The application supports drag-and-drop functionality for task movement and includes a search bar to filter tasks by title.

## Features

- **Task Stages:** The board is divided into four columns representing different stages of task management:
  - **To Do**
  - **In Progress**
  - **Peer Review**
  - **Done**

- **Task Cards:** Each task card displays:
  - **Task Title**
  - **Task Description** 

- **Drag-and-Drop:** You can drag and drop tasks between columns, allowing for easy task management across different stages.

- **Search Functionality:** A search bar at the top of the board allows users to filter tasks based on their title. As you type in the search bar, tasks matching the input will be displayed, while non-matching tasks will be hidden.

- **Add New Tasks:** A floating button enables users to create new tasks. New tasks are added to the "To Do" column. The task creation form includes fields for:
  - **Task Title**
  - **Task Description**
